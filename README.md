#Crystal Collector

This is a game created using HTML, CSS, and JQuery/Javascript.

Upon starting, there will be a goal amount and 4 gems displayed with a hidden value attached to it. The user only knows the value upon clicking on each gem.

The values of each click are added together in order to reach the goal amount.  If the user goes over, a "Try Again!" alert will appear. In contrast, if the user matches the goal amount, "Winner Winner!" will appear.

In both instances, once a message appears, the game will restart.
